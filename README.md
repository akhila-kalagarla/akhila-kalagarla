## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Akhila Kalagarla — a passionate and curious learner in the exciting world of technology. I actively participate in the global coding community and love building and exploring projects that challenge my creativity and technical skills.

🌐 A proud member of my college's coding club, I enjoy contributing to the tech community, learning from others, and sharing what I know.  
🤝 I’ve also mentored junior teams during hackathons, guiding them in choosing the right technologies, brainstorming project ideas, and ensuring smooth project execution.  
🏆 I secured **2nd Prize in a Machine Learning Hackathon**, and achieved **two-time wins in Python Coding Challenges** on Edyst platform.  
💡 I'm always excited to learn new technologies and improve my problem-solving abilities through hands-on experience.
